Findings: SDM > QL for everything in first pass ranking (split0 and split1)
0-5 title neighbors better than 10+
Children more useful than parents or combination thereof (perhaps because there are fewer of them)... so leaf nodes have shorter documents and end up being preferred.
This suggests that isLeaf will be a helpful reranking feature, same with numChildren.
